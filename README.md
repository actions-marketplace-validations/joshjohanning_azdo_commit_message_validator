# azdo_commit_message_validator

This is an action to be ran in a pull request to make sure that all commits have a `AB#123` in the commit message.

It also automatically links pull request to all of the Azure DevOps work item(s).

## Setup

1. Create a repository secret titled `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT`
2. Update the org name in the `action.yml` file under `env`

## How this works

The action loops through each commit and:
1. makes sure it has `AB#123` in the commit message
2. if yes, add a GitHub Pull Request link to the work item in Azure DevOps

Adding the link to the GitHub Pull Request was the tricky part.

If you use an API to look at the links of a work item with a GitHub pull request link, you will see:

```json
      "attributes": {
        "authorizedDate": "2022-08-02T18:45:03.567Z",
        "id": 3916078,
        "name": "GitHub Pull Request",
        "resourceCreatedDate": "2022-08-02T18:45:03.567Z",
        "resourceModifiedDate": "2022-08-02T18:45:03.567Z",
        "revisedDate": "9999-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      },
      "rel": "Artifact Link",
      "url": "vstfs:///GitHub/PullRequest/62f33e8a-c421-441d-88e1-06c46c4ffbbb%2f7"
```

Note the `url` field - `vstfs:///GitHub/PullRequest/62f33e8a-c421-441d-88e1-06c46c4ffbbb%2f7`

Creating a [new link is (relatively) easy with the API(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work-items/update?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1&tabs=HTTP#add-a-link), but you can't just use the regular GitHub pull request link. They use a garbled GUID that isn't the GUID or ID of the repo in GitHub. 

The GUID can be found using an (undocumented) API:

```
POST https://dev.azure.com/%DEVOPS_ORG%/_apis/Contribution/dataProviders/query?api-version=7.1-preview.1
```
